        <h3>My Culture</h3>
            <p>
            Kiwi kids are rocking it!! <br>
            Until moving to the UK I did not realise how much my culture was engraved in me. <br>
            Examples of this are commonly known traits like being a tidy Kiwi; valuing and respecting our environment and belongings. <br>
            Kiwi ingenuity, often facing problem solving with a calm chill approach. <br>
            Kiwis work together as a team and lift up one another, as most recently demonstrated though Covid-19. 
            </p>    
   
        <h3>My Leaning Style</h3>
            <p>
            I am resilient and determined. If I want something I will work for it until I get it! As a perfectionist I am learning to accept when things don't quite go to plan. I learn best in a physical environment with visual and auditory delivery. I then like to take the information and put it into relevant physical practice. I have faced lots of tough problems and I know in my current learning environment at Dev Academy I will face problems daily. From my past experiences I have built the strength and resilience to be able to take any challenge that comes my way. 
            </p>
     
        <h3>My Experience in a Team</h3>
            <p>
            Working to choreograph a dance, people want to include different moves based off of their personal strengths. However other dancers in that group may not feel confident to perform that style of choreography. This often causes tension in working together and can be resolved by changing formations, having those strong in that style near the front of the stage, or even using sections of choreography as solos or duos. 
            </p>
   
        <h3>Deeper Insight </h3>

            <p>
            My Myers Briggs personality type is INFJ (Advocate). 
            </p>
                <h4>
                    Someone with the Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging personality traits. <br>
                    They tend to approach life with deep thoughtfulness and imagination. Their inner vision, personal values, and a quiet, principled version of humanism guide them in all things. 
                </h4>
            <p>
            According to Myers Briggs this is the rarest personality type. 
            </p>

            <p>
            I have inner conflicts like wanting to stand up for what I am passionate about but I also wanting to keep everyone happy. As an empath I take on lots of other peoples feelings, caring for them but often at the expense of caring for myself. I value deep thoughtful relationships and struggle with small talk, I want to talk about “real” concepts, not the weather or what sport you like to watch on TV. <br>
            Growing up in a dance studio for 21 years, I have constantly been compared to the girl next to me in every way imaginable. This has now made me very sensitive to criticism, even when constructive. Highly sensitive people often feel as though they have a blessing and a curse, I am so self aware that sometime I would like to know less. <br>
            Because highly sensitive people stew over a problem this means I am constantly looking for a solution when something has not gone right. Often seeing the negative in environmental situations means that I can spot a problem most people would have missed. This can be flipped to be a strength as seeing these problems can save time and effort or even money. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I know a lot about myself and am currently learning what to do with this insight.
