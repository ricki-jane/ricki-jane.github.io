        <h3>IQ VS EQ a topic debated by many </h3>
            <p>
                Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognise your emotions, understand what they’re telling you, and realise how your emotions affect people around you. Emotional intelligence also involves your perception of others; when you understand how they feel, this allows you to manage relationships more effectively.
