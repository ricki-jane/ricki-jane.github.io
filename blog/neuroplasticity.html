        <h2>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset </h2>
        
    <div class=IVS>
       

      <h3>Neuroplasticity </h3>
            
          <p>
            Neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s ability to adapt. Brain activity is continually growing to make new connections in the brain. If you stop using pathways that have been made they will become redundant; use it or lose it! It is important that you understand this concept so you can apply it to your life and benefit yourself. 
          </p>    

          <p>
            Allowing your brain to adapt and change means you can learn new things, enhance existing cognitive capabilities, recover from injury, strengthen areas that are beginning to decline and improve brain fitness. Once you know that you have the potential to change your brain, hopefully you will apply the effort. 
          </p>

          <p>
            You can increase Neuroplasticity by defining clarity, changing behaviour and being critical about why you want to accomplish something. To find clarity you can ask yourself:
          </p>

            <ul>
                <li>What are your passions?</li>
                <li>What inspires you?</li>
                <li>What are your regrets?</li>
                <li>What challenges you have faced?</li>
                <li>What accomplishments are proud of?</li>
                <li>What core values do you have that you would pass on to children?</li>
                <li>What core values do other people see in you?</li>
                <li>What are three words to describe yourself?</li>
                <li>What significant life events that have helped to define you?</li>
                <li>What do others say about who you are at the core?</li>
            </ul>
          <p>
            Change is most likely to happen when you are interested and engaged in learning something new. This means you are ready for action, allowing the brain to release neurochemicals that are necessary to enable change in the brain. The more effort you apply the bigger the potential outcome. The more time you commit will also increase the potential outcome. Practice makes perfect!
          </p>

          <p>
            When the brain first learns something new, it will decide if the information should become permanent. Information is only stored if your brain deems the learning experience to be fascinating or if the behaviour holds and important outcome. When learning a new skill the brain only holds onto the good attempts, while discarding the bad. It then recalls the last good attempt and makes incremental adjustments to progressively improve. Remember when learning a positive attitude will get you much further than a negative one! Tell yourself you know you can do it, then it happens easier. If you tell yourself you're going to fail and it’s too hard, it will be much harder to succeed. The more you challenge your mind to learn, the more brain cells grow, leading to a stronger, smarter brain. As a result, things that once seemed hard actually become easier.

      <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>

          <p>
            Your mindset plays a crucial role in the learning process. If you have a fixed mindset, you tend to believe that you either have skills and intelligence or you don’t. You believe that you are not in control of your abilities. You focus on performance and results, while trying not to look bad. With a fixed mindset you look at effort as a negative thing, something that you do when you're not good enough. You may avoid challenging situations and feel discouraged when you make a mistake. When somebody with a fixed mindset receives feedback they get defensive, not seeing the value in the feedback and taking it personally.
           </p>

           <p>
            If you have a growth mindset, you tend to believe that skills and intelligence are grown and developed, you are good at something because you built that ability, and people who aren't good haven't done the work. You believe that you are in control of your abilities. You focus on learning and growing to achieve more skills over time. You know effort is valuable, useful and important for the learning process. You are more likely to embrace challenges and work through them. You see mistakes as learning opportunities, and when you receive feedback you appreciate it and apply it.
           </p>

           <p>
            Growth mindset creates a solid foundation for great learning. It is crucial to understand this so you can implement a growth mindset into your life. Learning something new can be scary, and you might get frustrated, but it’s only because you haven’t yet made the connections your brain needs. It’s up to you to take charge.

           <p>Here are some <a href="https://biglifejournal.com/blogs/blog/growth-mindset-mantras?"target="_blank">Growth Mindset Mantras,</a> I particularly like number 11. </p>

      <h3>My Learning Plan</h3>

      <p>To develop growth mindset into my learning plan I will</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Establish what I want to change</li>
                <li>Implement changes</li>
                <li>Make incremental improvements consistently</li>
                <li>Be open minded and prepared to make adaptations</li>
                <li>Guard my thinking with compassion</li>
                <li>Keep a solution focused attitude</li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            I want to change the negative voice inside my head. I am trying to apply positive self talk in all elements of my life. It is easier said than done to make the shift from negative self talk to positive. Seeing as this learning journey is a brand new place I want to start out with a good mindset from the get go. So far I am doing this well. My brain will believe what I tell it so I need to be kind to it. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I want to learn again how to handle criticism. By getting critique from a trusted source like my facilitator, with a kind supportive tone of voice, I hope I slowly become less sensitive to criticism again.
