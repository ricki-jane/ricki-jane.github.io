        <h2>Javascript Fundamentals </h2>
        
    <div class=IVS>
       

      <h3>An analogy for HTML and CSS differences: </h3>
            
          <p>
            HTML is like the structure of your face; eyes, mouth, cheeks, the basic structure of anatomy or framework. CSS is like the make-up you put on top; eyeshadow, lipstick, blusher, it enhances the structure to make it look better.    
          </p>    
              
      <h3>Control flow & Loops </h3>

          <p>
            Control flow is the order that the statements and functions are executed. Javascript reads code from top to bottom unless there is code to instruct it to change this control flow. This can be seen most commonly through a loop. <br>
            A loop we use in everyday life can be seen when scanning food at the supermarket self checkout. For every item in your basket, you scan the barcode and add the item to the shopping bag. This loop ends when the basket is empty.
           </p>

      <h3>DOM </h3>

            <p>
              DOM stands for Document Object Model. It allows us to interact with objects in a HTML document. It is like a family tree with parent and child elements. The greatest ancestor in the family tree is the Window. We are able to change elements, add or remove them by using Javascript. To interact with the DOM you can target a class you may wish to edit. This can be done by using the function 
            </p>
              
            <p><mark><strong>var elements = document.getElementsByClassName(names);</strong></mark></p>
            
            <p>
              This returns all the HTML elements with that particular class in an array.  You can then make any changes wanted.   
            </p>
         
       <h3>arrays and objects</h3>

            <p>
              Objects and arrays are a data type that are mutable. Objects can be used to store a collection of data. Arrays can be used to store a list of values.
            <br>
              Objects are used to represent a “thing” in your code. Anything that has characteristics could be used, the characteristics are called properties and they consist of a key and value. Objects can also contain arrays. To access an object, you can use either dot or bracket notation.
            <br>
              Arrays are used to create and store a list of multiple items in a single variable. Arrays can also consist of strings, numbers, booleans, objects, or even other arrays. They are useful when creating ordered lists where items in the list can be accessed by their index number. To access an array, you use bracket notation and an index number. Arrays start from [0] to access the first item. 
            </p>

        <h3>Functions</h3>

            <p>
              A Function is a specified block of code which is used to perform a specific task in the program. Functions reduce code redundancy, when a function is needed we can call on it. This saves us from having to re write lines of code multiple times. They increase maintainability. If we need to make a change it only needs to be made in one place. Functions help to solve complex problems and improve modularity, allowing a programmer to divide a big program into a number of small and manageable functions.
