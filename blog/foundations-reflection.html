      <h3>Three ego enlightenments</h3>
            
          <p>
            Reflecting back on foundations core learning, I have learnt so much information already and still have so far to go!
          </p>    

          <p>
            I know that I am not good at taking criticism, this is from previously being torn down, too far. However, in an environment that I am completely new to and have no prior knowledge in, my ego is level headed. I am happy to receive feedback from a trusted source because I know that the people I am listening to know more than me. In other areas of life my ego is more opinionated. My ego is learning to let go of the need to be right, and to not be offended. I need to realise that the better I get, the more humble I need to be, there is always something more I can learn. Putting myself in rooms where I’m the least knowledgeable person to observe and learn. That uncomfortable feeling, that defensiveness felt, I need to let it humble myself. As my island of knowledge grows, so does the shore of my ignorance.
          </p>

          <p>
            My ego is learning to surrender the need for control. I have always been a perfectionist completing everything the best I possibly can, usually to get a top A grade. Gripping on so tightly and identifying with external gratification is dangerous, because as soon as one thing slips, you loose happiness. In this new learning journey I am being sure not to place value on validation from others eyes. I can’t control if others are appreciative or like what I have done. My identity is not my job, my identity is not my achievements, my identity is not my material possessions. I hope to stop the ego seeking outward recognition and seek inward authenticity. I want to apply effort for myself, to make me happy, and for my personal development and future. Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self satisfaction in knowing I made the effort to do my best, to become the best that I am capable of becoming. At Dev Academy we do not receive grades, it is about the effort you put in to try make a solution. This aligns well with my ego learning to let go of control and enjoy the journey.
          </p>

          <p>
            My ego is learning to get out of its own mind. Meditation has been a great way to get out of the soundtrack in my head. I need to tap into calm, find some time for nature. Taking this time to reconnect and ground myself makes realise how small I am in relation to everything else. I need to cut through the haze with courage and live with the tangible and real, no matter how uncomfortable. It is not about the image of success but about living with purpose. 
          </p>

          <h3>Values, Empathy and self awareness</h3>

          <p>
            Values are at the core of everything we do. Empathy is important in the learning and programming process because we need to understand that we all respond differently to situations. To be the best team possible we need to respect each other and these responses.
            Self awareness is important to understand how and why you are reacting to situations. The person you are to yourself in your brain needs to be kind, and the person you are to work with in a team needs to be an empathetic team player.  Developing a culture that is focused on learning is characterised by respect, inclusion, empathy, collaboration, and safety. By ensuring your environment acknowledges diversity and the uniqueness of all people we are able to build positive respectful professional relationships. Strong relationships with the people you work with enables them to be active participants in processes and enhance outcomes.
          </p>

          <h3>A Challenge and a Surprise</h3>

          <p>
            The most challenging aspect of core learning is breaking my fixed mindset tendencies. Though I am improving greatly already in this area, it is what comes least naturally to my stubborn side. I was surprised to learn the concept of neuroplasticity and that we can always change our brain. I love sharing this new found knowledge with people because as someone who is in the process of shifting their mindset I understated the importance behind it. If we can never shift our mindset we will never grow or change, and our mistakes and our personal history would keep repeating. This is seen on a larger scale too. If we didn’t develop and internalise new knowledge we can’t grow as social competent human beings to work positivity moving forward together. 
          </p>
              
          <h3>Why learn core skills?</h3>

          <p>
            The core skills we learn at Dev Academy will always hold great importance in a workplace. This is why we are taught it alongside of the technical skills. In a role like programming these skills are even more of a necessity than in other job roles. Programming is stressful and you spend more time on things that don't work than things that do. Having an understanding of how to problem solve and be solution focused all while remaining calm is vital. In a team setting you don’t want to be the flustered cookie that no one wants to be around, developing self awareness can help you to be the best you and put your best foot forward. Developing skills such as empathy can help you help your team when they are struggling to keep it cool. We have to be able to reflect on our learning and be honest about how to improve and move forward. We need to acknowledge our mistakes or low points and see how we get through them using our growth cycle; reflecting on where we have come from, what we have done to improve it, and the positive learning outcome that we ended up with. Taking the time to work on core skills was a relaxing topic to learn about side by side to tech. Personally I need more time to practice programming but I don’t believe it should be in place over core skills. There is enough time for both skill sets to be taught, developed and learnt.
