        <h2>LEARNING PLAN</h2>
        
    <div class=IVS>
        <h3>Long Term Goal</h3>
            <p>
                My long term goal is to make websites for the dance schools across New Zealand.  I would also like to offer them a database so that companies can update from the old school ways of manually adding everything into excel. To get to this stage I first plan to work as a junior software developer with a local company while I continue build my skills. 
            </p>    
   
        <h3>Strengths & Limitations </h3>
            <p>
                I am empathetic. This means when working in a team I can understand peoples needs and work with them accordingly. I treat every individual differently based on who they are and how they function. We have all been shaped into who we are from the individual experiences we have had. When learning new things I enjoy I can focus for hours very well. I like to learn at a steady pace and ensure I have understood everything I am trying to absorb.  However, after a long day my brain shuts down and I become as grumpy as a three year old! This is where I reach my limitations, my social energy has run out and needs to be recharged. During this time I am not a team player as I get into a black and white thinking headspace. 
            </p>
     
        <h3>Human Skills</h3>
            <p>
                I would like to develop strategies to deal with stress. This is because not only does stress impact me as individual and the internal dialogue that comes when in this state of mind; it also effects my ability to be a great team player. Another great thing to learn in this time would be ideas surrounding professionalism. 
            </p>
   
        <h3>Workload </h3>
            <p>
                I am lucky that I do not have any other commitments while at EDA. This means majority of my time can be dedicated to my learning.  While in foundations I am trying to stick to a 9-5 schedule, with a couple of extra hours in the weekend. Sometimes my 9-5 look more like 12-8, but so long as I meet the overall 8 hours a day I am trying to achieve I am happy. I use toggl to track my time and I have found it to be great! 
                I am nervous for the long days to come during bootcamp as it takes me 1.5 hours of travel to campus each way. These 3 hours on the train extend my day by so much and the time sat there feels like wasted time where I am helpless.   
            </p>

        <h3>SEEKING HELP </h3>
            <p>
                I seek help first from Google, secondly by asking my peers, third by asking a facilitator. Depending on how big my problem is I may choose not to ask my peers if I think it will take too much of their time. I am extremely grateful when someone does take their time to work with me. I am trying to be active on Slack to build relationships with people and not be a passive member. When the going gets tough I need to take time to do the things I love and ground myself again. A relaxing spa before bed is always great, also a beachfront walk or playing drums. During my three months in Covid-19 isolation I gained an interest in meditation and yoga, it is awesome I will be able to extend this new interest at Dev Academy too!
             </p>
     
        <h3>Facilitator expectations</h3>
            <p>
                I have met my facilitator twice and she seems awesome! I feel like I can count on her to have my back to work with me in the best way for me. I require praise on my work to build my confidence and therefore achieve better outcomes as I feel successful. I need critique to be delivered in a very kind  tone of voice. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I look forward to seeing myself and team develop and grow together during our time at EDA.
